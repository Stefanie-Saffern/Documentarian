# Reference List for Documentarians


I saw this list on Write the Docs and for the past 18m added some of my own- feel free to enjoy!!
This is a composite list so if you want to add just send a PR. And thank you!

**DISCLAIMER** - I am not endorsing anything or anyone. These are just links I find useful. 

**DISCLAIMER #2** - this list was local to Israel. I am adding more links for a global audience.

This list (once done) will contain the resources from [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vi9K8LtJUSHFsKvF_6_QAroyekdOtgSdi0lrIf5hszA/edit?usp=sharing) - my original list, and [Michaela Reydt's list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAuD7OWwhxBF2oEAUq7c9xk22s4GdmFSFXJ-eJnF0Pg/edit?usp=sharing).
