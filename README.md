# Reference List for Documentarians


I saw this list on Write the Docs and for the past 18m added some of my own- feel free to enjoy!!
This is a composite list so if you want to add just send a PR. And thank you!

**DISCLAIMER** - I am not endorsing anything or anyone. These are just links I find useful. 

**DISCLAIMER #2** - this list was local to Israel. I am adding more links for a global audience.
